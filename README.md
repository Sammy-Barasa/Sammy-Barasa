A software developer, machine learning engineer, and hardware/firmware engineer with a background in Electronic and Computer Engineering, I bring a diverse set of skills and experience to every project I work on. My expertise covers API development, embedded development, web application building, and machine learning and deep learning. With a passion for project management and leadership, I am well-equipped to work on projects from start to finish, from design to implementation to deployment.
